# Global Valorant Info
__**Items :**__ Every Weapons (18 - Knife included / Classic excluded), Every Agents (27)
__Starting items :__ You'll start with Classic, any other weapon (Knife included) and any agent

__**Traps :__** Stay sharp on traps, some are for the current round and some for the next round (11 different ones at the moment for a total of 28 Traps)
__**Goal :__** Currently need to win with every agent up to Waylay (The requirement is only to have those but you still have to win with them)

Some may think PvP games aren't good to be AP, i think it's true only if you go ranked and throw every game you're in, now if you don't want to go in Swift, it's your choice, but it's the recommended game mode.
This Manual is meant to be played by Experienced Valorant players or Veterans, Beware of the difficulty if you are new !
It can be played solo or coop, but beware, it's harder to win when you are 5 with only Classic and Operator
Quick advice, if you have only one agent, don't forget to fast pick

There is currently no settings, because i'm not English and i struggle really hard to make those, if someone have the  knowledge to do it, it'll be delightful to shatter it myself to learn
